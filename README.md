**Who are we and what do we do:**

Zoomala is a web application that helps students from all around Lebanon to be able to connect with likeminded peers and gain advice from experienced professionals, while also offering them an opportunities portal where they could search for jobs and internships in and outside of Lebanon. Because of the high unemployment rate within Lebanese youth reaching more than 35% and the unpopular internship culture in Lebanese universities.

**Vision:**

Through Zoomala platform, we intend on providing an easier transition from academics to the professional world for students from high school to university level. The website provides users with a portal where they can find scholarships and professional development opportunities to kick start a successful career in their field of passion through early gained experience.

**Process:**

<t>Our</t> process model is Agile since it provides us with greater flexibility while developing our project; the development process relied heavily on Dr. Bdeirâ€™s feedback throughout the check points as one of our stakeholders with sprints of 2-weeks length. Moreover, scrum meetings helped us develop a sense of self-accountability as we are working on our first software engineering project. Each user stories would go from prioritization where we decide the value of the feature, we break it into smaller elements and reveal its dependencies on other website components, create UML diagrams for these dependencies and then we design a template for how the user story would be viewed by the user. Designing fields and backend models is the stage after when bugs are introduced trying to integrate the new user story with the already existing user stories; new bugs are handled through a team meeting where the developer who encountered the bug presents an analysis on how the bug was introduced, the rest of the team members go over a list of suggestions to understand what solutions the developer went through to solve this bug. If no clear solution appears we make a short code freeze to read more about Django documentation and consult online resources (videos, articles) and present our resources to the responsible developer, structure collaboration if they -the developer- needs more team members to assist them in there debugging. The collaborators draft their solution and start the implementation while the other two members do a daily check out on the debugging team until the feature is ready to be tested.

**What did we use:**

*   Python
*   Django Rest Framwork/crispy-form
*   Crispyform
*   Bootstrap
*   CSS
*   JavaScript
